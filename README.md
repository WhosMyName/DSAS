# DarkSoulsAutoSave - DSAS

DarkSoulsAutoSave is a fellow Tool, which automagically Backs-Up your Dark Souls I Save and stores/sorts them.

It uses a 100 Save-Limit Loop in 10 Minute Cycles, which implies 16.66666666666667 Hours of Fun and Death, and no worries about your Saves.

I actually don't know now big a Savefile can get but from my 2 Chars, a 4 MB Save and a 10 Char limit, I'll estimate 21 MB per "full" Save, which will add up to 2.1 GB of Space.

So keep if safe, don't play too long and quit DSAS, to prevent your Harddrive from suffering a horrible Death.

A big shout out to my bois and grills from Microsoft, why am I not able to use colon(:) to properly display the Time inside of the Filename, in the Worlds greatest OS, according to Microsoft. _\*sighs\*_
